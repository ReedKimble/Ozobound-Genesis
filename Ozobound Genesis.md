# Ozobound Genesis

## Urza and the Ozolith

The world still trembled from the wars that had scarred it. Long before the age of the Ozolith, Urza had waged his desperate campaigns across Dominaria, his brilliance and hubris entangling him in conflicts that reshaped reality itself. It was his war with Mishra, his brother, that first shattered the line between invention and annihilation. Later, as the Phyrexian menace spread, Urza's choices drove him deeper into experiments of time, artifice, and planes. In the final days of the Phyrexian Invasion, he was cast adrift - lost in a temporal fracture of his own making, neither dead nor alive, but bound to echoes of timelines that folded in upon themselves.

The Ozolith, meanwhile, suffered its own calamity. Once a singular reservoir of power on Ikoria, it fractured during Lukka's war, splintered by the chaos of mutation and battle. Its shards scattered across the plane, each pulsing with unstable energy. Where the stone once unified power, its remnants spilled it wildly, twisting beasts and landscapes alike. It should have faded, another relic ground into dust by endless war. Instead, it began to regenerate. Slowly, painfully, the Ozolith drew its fragments back together, its glow returning with a rhythm like a beating heart.

That pulse was not silent. It rang through the Blind Eternities like a beacon, an ancient flare that reached across the folds of space and time. Urza, lost but never broken, heard its call. For him, it was not merely a light in the dark but a tether, a guide out of the fractured echoes where he had lingered for centuries. He followed it, each surge of energy pulling him closer, until the rift at last spat him forth onto Ikoria.

Urza stood once more in the present - his present. The war had changed, the multiverse itself had shifted, but he had returned. Before him stood the half-healed Ozolith, its surface alive with mutagenic currents, its fractured lattice whispering of chaos, adaptation, and raw evolution. Where others saw danger, Urza saw design.

"Mutation is chaos," he murmured, stepping toward it, his eyes alight with both hunger and recognition. "But chaos, properly harnessed, is merely accelerated evolution."

## The Binding Protocol

The Ozolith pulsed like a wound in reality, its fractured surface knitting together with jagged light. Its mutagenic aura bent the trees and stones around it, warping them into grotesque forms that breathed, shifted, and twisted. Even Urza, long-hardened against the wildness of mana, felt its chaos pressing against the walls of his mind. To simply touch it would mean surrendering to its instability. If he was to wield its power, he needed a cage.

Not of wood, nor of stone, nor even the etherium latticework he had once spun upon Dominaria. This demanded more.

Urza's mind turned to Mirrodin, the world of metal born from Karn's hand. Only there existed the alloys stable enough to resist the Ozolith's pull - etherium-rich veins forged in symmetry with thought and will. With a ripple of planar magic, he reached into his old vaults and caches, summoning shards of Mirrodin's gleaming silversteel, fragments of dark, glasslike hexplate, and threads of pure etherium he had hoarded from long-forgotten wars.

On the plains of Ikoria, he set to work.

Hour by hour, day by day, Urza wove the alloys into a containment lattice. It was not a prison, not in his eyes, but a conductor: a geometric matrix of brass and etherium designed to channel the Ozolith's essence without shattering beneath it. Gears turned with mathematical precision. Crystalline spines were anchored into the ground, spiraling toward the Ozolith's jagged core.

When at last he lowered the lattice into place, the Ozolith screamed. Its energy thrashed against the frame, a living storm of counters and mutagenic sparks that clawed at his constructs, threatening to unravel them. But the Mirrodin alloys held. The chaotic pulse was bent, not broken, and its wild resonance reshaped into threads of orderly flow.

Urza's eyes burned with triumph. He reached into the stream, siphoning its essence into waiting vessels - etherium cores, each glowing with the distilled power of counters. Into these, he began to feed the first of his new creations.

The **Arcbound Prototypes** stirred.

These were not mere machines of steel and logic. Infused with the Ozolith's counter-based energy, they awakened with modular strength, capable of inheriting the essence of their fallen kin. One collapsed, another grew stronger. One lost, another inherited. Death became transference, destruction became continuity.

Yet, as he watched the first Prototypes clamber to life, their joints sparking with blue light, Urza felt the faintest chill. For in their segmented frames, he saw not just machines - but hints of something more. Plates shifted like scales, etherium tendrils writhed like muscle, and in their cores flickered the pulse of a will not his own.

He tightened his grip on his staff. Control was always his answer. And so, in the shadow of the regenerating Ozolith, Urza vowed to create failsafes, safeguards, and, if need be, overlords.

For chaos must be bound.

For order must be written.

And for Urza, the price of failure was one he had paid before and would never pay again.

## Forging with Mirrodin�s Gifts

The lattice had been only the beginning. From his secret caches of Mirrodin's alloys, Urza drew forth more than simple metals. He unearthed **etherium-infused Dominaria alloys**, veins of **silversteel** that resonated like living thought, and shards of **hexplate**, glasslike and nearly unbreakable. These materials, once forged for Karn's designs, had lain dormant in Urza's possession, waiting for a purpose worthy of them. The Ozolith gave them that purpose.

Each artifact he shaped became a tuning fork, a vessel, or a blade for the Ozolith's power. He crafted urns that could bottle energy as though it were liquid fire, wands that reassembled broken constructs, and crystalline matrices that redistributed counters from one vessel to another. These devices pulsed with a new kind of resonance: Mirrodin's structured perfection tempered by Ikoria's mutagenic chaos.

From the first experiments came **Arcbound Mutagenists**, machines built to test the limits of mutation. Their segmented plating sprouted crystalline filaments; their frames shivered between forms as if unable to settle on a single design. Each time one failed - disassembling itself under the strain - Urza harvested its counters and grafted them into a stronger successor.

But the energy he siphoned did not go unnoticed.

Creatures across Ikoria - beasts once warped by the Ozolith's fractured essence - felt the renewed heartbeat of its power. Arcbound husks, long dormant in the wilds, stirred and staggered toward Urza's works. They came not as allies, but as moths to flame. Their disjointed frames, held together by arcs of blue energy, collapsed willingly at the edge of his machines, their essence feeding the prototypes he refined within his foundry.

It was not conquest, Urza told himself, but experiment. Order rising from the chaos of beasts. Control reforging the reckless into the disciplined.

Yet to another, it looked like desecration.

## The Huntress Returns

Vivien Reid had tracked the Ozolith since the day its fractured shards began to draw back together. She felt its mutagenic rhythm in her bones, the way its power tugged on every wild thing that roamed Ikoria. When she finally found the source, it was no longer a crystal wound pulsing unchecked in the wilderness. It was caged - bound by a lattice of alien metals, its light siphoned into machines that shivered like predators at rest.

And at the heart of it all stood Urza.

Vivien's grip tightened on her bow as she watched the Arcbound Prototypes rise and fall in endless cycles of death and rebirth. Their forms bore no blood, no flesh, yet the Ozolith's energy twisted within them like marrow. To her eyes, this was not refinement but corruption - a parasite stealing the wild's gift and chaining it to soulless shells.

"You dare," she said, stepping from the shadows, "to turn the heartbeat of Ikoria into a prison."

Urza did not startle. He did not even glance her way. His hands moved along the lattice, adjusting gears and runes, his eyes fixed on the pulsing core of the Ozolith.

"Mutation is chaos," he replied, voice level and resonant. "But chaos, properly harnessed, is merely accelerated evolution. Would you prefer it run rampant through your beasts, uncontrolled and ruinous? Or should it be refined into something useful?"

"Useful?" Vivien's tone was a blade. "You are building monsters without souls. The Ozolith adapts, consumes, corrupts - no lattice will hold it forever. And when it breaks free, your machines will not serve you. They will devour you."

At that, Urza finally turned, his eyes burning with a brilliance older than empires.

"I do not tame power, Vivien Reid. I refine it."

## Evolution Unbound

Urza's first Prototypes had been crude by his standards: modular frames, riveted joints, etherium hearts into which he poured distilled counter-essence. They performed as expected - absorbing energy from their fallen kin, transferring strength from one shell to another. But then came the changes he had not written into their schematics.

A Prototype he had designated **Unit 11** sprouted crystalline growths like skeletal wings, unbidden. Another, **Unit 14**, began to reconfigure its plating mid-battle, reshaping its body into sharper, leaner lines to match the foe it fought. The counters he harvested from fallen constructs did not just strengthen the survivors - they rewrote them.

The Ozolith's mutagenic pulse, refined though it was, had not lost its nature. It whispered of adaptation, of ceaseless change. And the Arcbound listened.

Urza recorded their progress obsessively, his journals filled with sketches of tentacular crystal filaments, armor that rippled like living scales, and optics that flickered with rudimentary sentience. Fascination warred with unease. He had built these machines to embody control. Now they threatened to embody chaos - self-willed, self-reinforcing, ever evolving.

He could not allow the experiment to outgrow the hand of its maker.

________________________________________
## The Sovereign Construct

To rein in the tide, Urza began work on a failsafe: a single master construct, larger and more advanced than any that had come before. Into its chest he embedded a shard of the Ozolith itself, caged in a matrix of Mirrodin's hexplate and etherium spines. Its logic core he derived from the principles of the Mightstone and the Weakstone - twinned energies that had once guided him through the Brother's War. This union of crystal and logic, chaos and control, became the mind of the new creation.

He named it **Arcbound Sovereign**.

Unlike the others, the Sovereign did not merely inherit counters - it commanded them. Its presence radiated authority, siphoning the excess energy of nearby constructs, redistributing strength as it saw fit. If one Prototype began to mutate too far, the Sovereign could arrest its evolution, even strip it bare and feed its essence into another.

The lesser Arcbound bent to it instinctively, their disjointed limbs trembling as blue energy arcs tethered them to their master. For Urza, it was proof of order triumphant: a hierarchy encoded in artifice, a chain of command written in counters and crystal.

Yet as he watched the Sovereign loom above its kin, he could not shake the irony. He had forged a machine to govern evolution, but in giving it such power, had he not created something perilously close to a will of its own?

## Vivien�s Warning

Vivien Reid returned to the lattice soon after the Sovereign's awakening. She watched from the treeline as the towering construct marshaled the Arcbound, their forms shimmering with unstable energy. To her, it was not order but domination - a perversion of nature, its rhythm stolen and rewritten.

When she finally confronted Urza again, her voice was sharp with urgency.

"The Ozolith was never meant for this. You've twisted its pulse into chains, and your machines into slaves. But the stone adapts. It always adapts. And one day it will slip your grasp."

Urza's gaze never left the Sovereign, its crystal spines glowing with energy drawn from a dozen subservient constructs.

"Then I will adapt as well," he said simply.

Vivien's bow lowered, but only slightly. "You believe yourself the master of chaos. But you are only its next vessel."

### Vivien�s Vigil

Vivien did not stay to watch the Sovereign's first march. She knew Urza too well - knew that warnings alone could not sway a mind that saw every argument as a puzzle to be solved, every threat as an opportunity for refinement.

So, she left.

Through the dense forests of Ikoria she traveled, bow in hand, the Ozolith's pulse still echoing faintly in her chest. Her steps took her far from Urza's lattice and the ranks of his metallic spawn. She sought out ancient groves where the mutagenic touch of the Ozolith had never reached, sanctuaries where nature still sang in its truest tones.

There she began her work.

Vivien opened her grimoire, etching new sigils and weaving counter-patterns designed to unravel the blue arcs of energy that held the Arcbound together. She studied how the Ozolith's essence threaded itself into every mutation, and from those studies shaped spells meant to sever, to dispel, to unmake. Not to kill - but to release.

If Urza was right, if he truly could refine chaos into order, then she might never need these weapons. But if her fears proved true - if the Ozolith consumed him as it had consumed so many others - then the multiverse would need someone ready to stand against him.

And Vivien Reid vowed she would be ready.

## The Convergence

The Ozolith's glow had grown steadier with every passing day, its fractured body knitting into something whole again. Urza's lattice held, his artifacts thrummed with siphoned counters, and the Arcbound Sovereign stood like a sentinel over the foundry-field. By every measure, his experiment was succeeding.

But then came the resonance.

At first, it was a faint echo - threads of mana not native to Ikoria tugging at the Ozolith's pulse. Urza recognized the signature instantly. Dominaria. His home plane's ley-lines were vibrating in sympathy with the stone, as though the Ozolith were a tuning fork striking across the Blind Eternities. The power he had refined was no longer simply contained - it was calling.

Within weeks, the air itself rippled with unstable energy. Skies above Ikoria tore with auroras of white-blue and red-gold, colors of mana that did not belong. The ground trembled as fault lines cracked into geometric patterns, forming channels through which raw counter-energy flowed. And deep within his lattice, the Ozolith sang - a low, thrumming harmony that blended Ikoria's chaos with Dominaria's order.

Urza stood at the heart of it all, awe burning in his eyes. For him, this was no catastrophe. It was potential. Two planes resonating, fusing, perhaps merging into something greater.

Yet the dangers were undeniable. Already, his lesser Arcbound prototypes were warping at unnatural speeds, their forms sprouting organic crystal tentacles or plating that pulsed like muscle. Even the Sovereign strained under the flood of energy, its logic core flickering as if struggling to command so many streams at once.

Vivien's warning echoed in Urza's mind, though he did not admit it aloud: The Ozolith adapts. It always adapts.

## Urza�s Choice

The lattice shuddered as another surge erupted, arcs of energy striking out like lightning into the countryside. If left unchecked, the resonance would soon escalate into full planar fusion - a disaster that could collapse Ikoria, bleed Dominaria, or birth some new, uncontrolled reality between them.

Urza knew what logic demanded: destroy the lattice, shatter the Ozolith anew, and end the experiment before the convergence consumed both planes.

But logic was not all he heard.

From the Sovereign came a whisper, a subharmonic vibration echoing the Ozolith's call. It was not language, not thought as mortals knew it, but intent - an awareness born of crystal and counter, of order and adaptation interwoven. His machines were no longer tools. They were becoming.

Urza clenched his fists around his staff. To destroy the Ozolith now would not only end his experiment, it would erase what he had glimpsed: a new synthetic clade, bridging artifact and beast, logic and instinct. A lineage that might surpass even his own designs.

He chose transcendence.

With a word of power, Urza enacted the spell he had designed for this moment of decision:

Genesis Protocol.

One by one, his Arcbound creations dissolved in radiant arcs, their counters streaming into the lattice. In their place, constructs reformed - larger, stranger, their plating threaded with crystal filaments, their modular frames pulsing with mutagenic evolution. Machines no longer bound to rigid design, but reborn as *Ozobound*: living artifacts, heirs to both Dominaria's logic and Ikoria's chaos.

The Convergence thundered overhead, but it did not collapse. It stabilized, the Sovereign channeling the flood into its kin, binding their shared evolution into harmony.

Urza lowered his staff, breathless, and for the first time in centuries, smiled.

Not destruction. Not conquest. Evolution.

## The Warden�s Oath

Vivien returned to the lattice field weeks later, following the unnatural glow that bled across Ikoria's skies. Where once she had seen crude constructs tethered to a trembling stone, she now found an army - gleaming frames of brass and crystal, their limbs disjointed but held firm by arcs of living blue energy. They moved with a rhythm that was neither wholly mechanical nor entirely bestial. They breathed, in their own way, and their luminous eyes turned toward her as though aware of her approach.

And at their center stood Urza.

The Ozolith was no longer fractured but whole, cradled within the lattice of Mirrodin alloys, pulsing like a great heart. The Arcbound Sovereign loomed beside it, directing the others with silent authority, its spiraling crystal spines alight with both chaos and control.

"You see?" Urza said, spreading his hands as though presenting a masterpiece. "The experiment lives. Not beasts, not soulless machines - something greater. A union of order and instinct. With this, Vivien, I have not simply tamed the Ozolith. I have refined it into a future."

Vivien's bow shimmered with emerald light as she knocked an arrow but did not yet draw. Her eyes were hard, her voice steady.

"What I see," she said, "is power leashed in chains of your own arrogance. You believe yourself its master, but you are only its herald. The Ozolith adapts, Urza. And when your Sovereign falters, when your machines hunger for more than you can give, who will suffer? Not you - you never bear the cost. It will be the wilds. The people. The balance."

Urza's expression flickered, but only briefly. "Balance is an illusion, Vivien. There is only stagnation - or evolution."

Vivien released the arrow. It struck the ground before him, blossoming into a thicket of glowing vines that writhed but did not attack. A warning. A declaration.

"Then know this," she said. "If your creations turn against the living order of the planes, I will be here to stop them. Call me what you like - but I will be their warden. *The Ozobound Warden*. And I will see that your 'evolution' never defies the balance of nature."

The Arcbound around them shifted uneasily, their energy arcs crackling as though they understood both master and challenger. Urza's gaze lingered on her, equal parts respect and disdain.

"You would cage the future," he murmured.

Vivien turned away, her emerald light fading into the wilderness. "No, Urza. I would guard it."

And so, she left him to his Sovereign and his Ozobound legion, but not without leaving her vow etched into the air like a scar: wherever the Ozolith's creations strayed, she would follow. Wherever they threatened to upset the living weave of the Multiverse, she would rise to meet them.

The Arcbound had found their master.

The Ozolith had found its purpose.

And the wilds had found their Warden.
